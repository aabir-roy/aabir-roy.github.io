      <description>After a hectic midsem week, The Radio Astronomy Club, BITS Pilani decided to open up the SWAN system and start setup. We scheduled a meet with the IIT Kanpur SWAN team, and they guided us through the process.
To power on a system you require, well, power. However, a small but not so insignificant problem stood in our path - we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the main power plug for the receiver system!</description>

      <description>The brainchild of Dr. Avinash Despande, the Indian Sky Watch Array Network aims to set up a group of radio telescopes across institutes in India, with the long-term goal of having a country wide radio interferometer which will help in the imaging of FRBs, pulsars and other astronomical sources.
It will significantly enchance Indian observing capabilities in the radio frequencies and also establish a sustainable approach to cultivate and support upcoming generations of skilled radio astronomers in India, enabling them to tackle challenges and spearhead compelling research in the field of radio astronomy.</description>
