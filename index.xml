      <title>Cross-compiling the Raspberry Pi Linux kernel with the PREEMPT_RT patch</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Compiling the Linux kernel on a Raspberry Pi is slow. This isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising considering the Raspberry Pi is more meant to run custom kernels, rather than build them. A better approach would be to cross-compile the kernel on a more powerful x86 machine and then transfer it to the Pi. This saves a lot of time, time that you can spend actually using the Pi for your projects, instead of waiting for the kernel to build.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>First setup of the SWAN system</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a hectic midsem week, The Radio Astronomy Club, BITS Pilani decided to open up the SWAN system and start setup. We scheduled a meet with the IIT Kanpur SWAN team, and they guided us through the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To power on a system you require, well, power. However, a small but not so insignificant problem stood in our path - we couldn’t find the main power plug for the receiver system! The search for this elusive plug led to us unscrewing the bottom-most panel where we found the cable coiled up under the receiver, explaining our inability to locate it. We connected it to a 230V supply and switched on the circuit breakers to check for power in the extension board.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The brainchild of Dr. Avinash Despande, the Indian Sky Watch Array Network aims to set up a group of radio telescopes across institutes in India, with the long-term goal of having a country wide radio interferometer which will help in the imaging of FRBs, pulsars and other astronomical sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will significantly enchance Indian observing capabilities in the radio frequencies and also establish a sustainable approach to cultivate and support upcoming generations of skilled radio astronomers in India, enabling them to tackle challenges and spearhead compelling research in the field of radio astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setup Multiple Git Accounts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Git is an indispensible part of my workflow. I happen to use git for both my personal and work related projects. However, moving between these accounts can be challenging at times. In order to counter this, we can make use of a feature called &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_conditional_includes&#34;&gt;conditional includes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup-ssh-keys&#34;&gt;Setup ssh keys&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To start with let’s set up the ssh keys for each of our accounts. Check for any existing ssh keys in the &lt;code&gt;.ssh&lt;/code&gt; directory, and remove them if not in use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
